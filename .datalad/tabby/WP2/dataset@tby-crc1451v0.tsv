title	Neural signatures of motor control under uncertainty for different effectors in the healthy young and ageing human brain						
description	"This dataset of B04 work package 2 comprises fMRI data and behavourial read-outs (manual and saccadic response times) for three different cueing tasks to investigate the neural networks underlying motor control under uncertainty in the skeletomotor and oculomotor system from two different age groups (n=30 volunteers aged between 18 and 35, n=30 volunteers aged between 60 and 75 years). These data shall reveal crucial insights into common or effector-specific predictive inference processes and underlying brain network dynamics in the motor system
and their changes with ageing."
